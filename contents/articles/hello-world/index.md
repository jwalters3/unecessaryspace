First post. Probably not a lot going on here

<span class="more"></span>

I'm really terrible about actually putting thoughts down in <del>some</del> any form, so it should be interesting if I'm able to keep this up.  I might be doing this more for the fun of discovering a new way to add something to the internet.  Who knows?  Anyway, I have the admin work done for setting up wintersmith on github pages and linking my domain here (kinda obviously). I still have to tweak the look and feel of the site and customize away.  Probably add some color? 

Well, time for sleep I guess so this is a project for another day.
